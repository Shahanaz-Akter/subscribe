<!-- node version 18 and php version 8.1 here -->

First of all you have to craete one project using this command "composer create-project laravel/laravel project-name"
step-1 laravel new tenancy (installed a tenancy named object in root file)
step-2 installed all of the possible packages about tenants
step-2 setup .env file DB name "tenancy"
step-3 use this command for install breeze package and built-in tailwind css --->composer require laravel/breeze --dev
step-4 php artisan breeze:install (blade, darkMood, PHPUnit)
The breeze:install command will prompt you for your preferred frontend stack
step-5 php artisan migrate
step-6 npm install && npm run dev (getting user interface like login, registration, logout.....)

step-7 php artisan tenancy:install
✔️ Created config/tenancy.php
✔️ Created routes/tenant.php
✔️ Created TenancyServiceProvider.php
✔️ Created migrations. Remember to run [php artisan migrate]!
✔️ Created database/migrations/tenant folder.

$ php artisan tenancy:install
Installing stancl/tenancy...
✔️ Created config/tenancy.php
Found routes/tenant.php.
✔️ Created TenancyServiceProvider.php
✔️ Created migrations. Remember to run [php artisan migrate]!
Following files are generated by those commands:

<!-- app>database>migrations>tenant nmed folder is generated

app>database>migrations>2019_09_15_000020_create_domains_table.php and 2019_09_15_000010_create_tenants_table.php table is created.

app>providers>TenancyServiceProvider.php file is generated

Tenancy object is created in the root folder.

app>config>tenancy.php -->

step-8 add this service provider into app>config>app.php
"App\providers\TenancyServiceProvider::class," append it into app.php

step-9 make anew model called php artisan make:model Tenant
step-10 Now make one tenant Model and inside this model paste this code"<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Stancl\Tenancy\Database\Models\Tenant as BaseTenant;
use Stancl\Tenancy\Contracts\TenantWithDatabase;
use Stancl\Tenancy\Database\Concerns\HasDatabase;
use Stancl\Tenancy\Database\Concerns\HasDomains;

class Tenant extends BaseTenant implements TenantWithDatabase
{
use HasDatabase, HasDomains;
}"

step-11 Replace the code intgo app>config>tenancy.php
step-12 php artisan tinker

use Stancl\Tenancy\Database\Models\Domain;
// use Stancl\Tenancy\Database\Models\Tenant;
use App\Models\Tenant;
'tenant_model' => Tenant::class,

step_12 php artisan migrate:fresh --seed (if need)
step-13 php artisan tinker
step-14 $tenant = App\Models\Tenant::create()

"generated = App\Models\Tenant {#5108
data: null,
id: "2b99fc5d-3807-431a-a869-30324d96c5b0",
updated_at: "2024-06-23 10:27:49",
created_at: "2024-06-23 10:27:49",
tenancy_db_name: "tenant2b99fc5d-3807-431a-a869-30324d96c5b0",
}
"
step- 15 write this command like $tenant->domains()->create(['domain' => 'test.localhost']);
;
step-16 App\Providers\RouteServiceProvider have to use this code

$this->routes(function () {
Route::middleware('api')
->prefix('api')
->domain('localhost')
->group(base_path('routes/api.php'));

            Route::middleware('web')
                 ->domain('localhost')
                ->group(base_path('routes/web.php'));
        });

step-17: tenancy>config>tenancy.php
step-18: each tenants route will be declared into routes>tennat.php using their domain middleware group
step-19: each tenants controller and view will be created by using another folder into comntroller and View folder like conmtroller>Tenant>Tenantcontroller>or
View>Tennat>register.blade.php like this way.
step-20: Super admin will manage overall tenants system and his own manage as usual. He has power for doing all of this pproject. like suing tennacy-register route
he can register each tenannt customly I have created it.
step-20: Now i will Create Each tenants databases table where each tables will be stored into database>migrations>tenant folder.
Each Database and their table will be placed there after migration files.
step-21: migration creating ---> php artisan make:migration create_users_table --path=database/migrations/tenant
step-22: migartion commands for all tenants users table: php artisan tenants:migrate
